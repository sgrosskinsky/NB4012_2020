- click on notebooks to view them
- to edit and run notebooks on your machine clicking on green code download button to download a zip file
- you need to install Jupyter notebook and Python 3 to edit and run notebooks. A relatively simple way is to do this with Anaconda, see here for a desciption: https://test-jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html

Content of Notebooks:

- Support Class 1: linear algebra, Gershgorin theorem, simple random walk
- Support Class 2: branching processes, Urn models for reinforcement processes
- Support Class 3: Wright-Fisher model of population dynamics
