Computational resources

This repository contains support material in Python 3 for the course NB4012 Stochastic Processes and Applications, TU Delft, 2020.

- click on notebooks to view them
- to edit and run notebooks on your machine clicking on green code download button to download a zip file
- you need to install Jupyter notebook and Python 3 to edit and run notebooks. A relatively simple way is to do this with Anaconda, see here for a desciption.

Content of Notebooks:

- class 1: linear algebra, Gershgorin theorem, simple random walk
- class 2: branching processes
- class 3: Wright-Fisher model of population dynamics
- class 4: Urn models for reinforcement processes
